# HumbleNishiyama
Monte Carlo simulations of the Humble-Nishiyama randomness game, a variation of Penney's game. Testing different versions / rules / programming approaches of Humble-Nishiyama to determine changes in win-rate and also runtime efficiency. First major project of Automation &amp; Workflows (Fall 2025) taught by Ron Smith at the College of William &amp; Mary. 

## Quick Start (PROFESSOR SMITH)
Navigate to the directory and run the following commands:

`uv sync`

then

`python run_tests.py`

This will create the data folder locally, containing the deck files (.npz) for each method, as well as a log file (.txt) and summary of results (.txt) in a table. These results will also be printed to the terminal.
